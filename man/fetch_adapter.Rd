\title{Fetch a syberia IO adapter.}
\usage{

}
\arguments{

}
\value{
an \code{adapter} object (defined in this package, syberiaStages)
}
\description{
IO adapters are (reference class) objects that have a \code{read}
and \code{write} method. By wrapping things in an adapter, you do not have to
worry about whether to use, e.g., \code{read.csv} versus \code{s3read}
or \code{write.csv} versus \code{s3store}. If you are familiar with
the tundra package, think of adapters as like tundra containers for
importing and exporting data.
}
\details{
For example, we can do: \code{fetch_adapter('file')$write(iris, '/tmp/iris.csv')}
and the contents of the built-in \code{iris} data set will be stored
in the file \code{"/tmp/iris.csv"}.
